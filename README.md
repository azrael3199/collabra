# Collabra

Collabra is a platform for creating and editing documents in real-time.

This project is built with Next.js, a React framework for building server-side rendered websites and web applications. It also uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Drizzle ORM for database operations.

The project is built with a focus on security and scalability, with a robust authentication system and a scalable database design.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it.
2. Run `npx pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npx pnpm run db:generate` to generate the database schema.
4. Run `npx pnpm run db:push` to push the schema to the PostgreSQL database.
5. Run `npx pnpm run dev` to start the development server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
